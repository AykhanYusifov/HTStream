    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>HTStream is a fast, quality control pipeline for HTS data. The difference between HTStream and other pipelines is that HTStreams uses a tab delimited fastq format which allows for streaming from application to application.
    
    This streaming creates some awesome efficiencies when processing HTS data.

    <ul>
        <li>No intermediate files (saves on files storage)</li>
        <li>Reduce I/O (files are only read in and written out once)</li>
        <li>Handles both single end and paired end reads at the same time</li>
        <li>Processes can work at the same time allowing for process parallelization</li>
    </ul>
